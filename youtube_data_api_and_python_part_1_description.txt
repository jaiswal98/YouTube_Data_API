In this video series, we will be building a Python script that utilizes PyTube; a Python module used for downloading video content from YouTube in addition to the YouTube Data API provided from Google and YouTube to directly access specific metadata from YouTube URLs. 

In this project, we process a list of YouTube URLs and download the respective title, description, and high-quality download of the video at the link.

This is a mini-project that showcases something that you can build from the ground up and something that hopefully you can expand upon!
